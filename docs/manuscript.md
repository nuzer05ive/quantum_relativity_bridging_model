## Abstract

The Quantum Relativity Bridging Model (QRBM) unifies classical, quantum, and relativistic physics through recursive retrograde motion. By introducing concepts such as Rood’s Constant, FISH Factor, and L Geometries, QRBM demonstrates harmonic resonance across dynamic systems.

Key validations include the sphere-to-cube harmonic growth, solutions to prime number gaps, and a recursive framework that bridges quantum and relativistic physics. QRBM powers advancements in AI, physics simulations, and universal optimization, offering profound implications for science and society.
